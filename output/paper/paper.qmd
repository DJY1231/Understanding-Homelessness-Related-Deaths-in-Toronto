# 2 Introduction

Homelessness is a growing concern in urban landscapes, and Toronto has experienced a troubling surge in recent years. The visible presence of individuals lacking stable housing permeates city streets, reflecting a complex societal issue that demands urgent attention. As the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to rise, the consequences extend far beyond immediate challenges, impacting public health, safety, and overall community well-being.

This multifaceted challenge to the city's social fabric stems from factors such as economic disparities, housing affordability, mental health issues, and insufficient support systems. Against this backdrop, Toronto Public Health initiated a comprehensive tracking system in January 2017 to document and analyze deaths among individuals experiencing homelessness. This paper aims to unravel the intricacies of the dataset on Deaths of People Experiencing Homelessness in Toronto, offering insights into the gravity of the issue and contributing to a broader understanding of the societal implications of homelessness-related deaths.

The causes of death among individuals experiencing homelessness encompass a range of challenges, including cancer, accidents, cardiovascular diseases, pneumonia, suicide, homicide, COVID-19 disease, and the enigmatic realm of unknown causes. Among these, a stark pattern emerges, with a disproportionate number of cases attributed to drug toxicity. The prevalence of deaths due to drug toxicity not only underscores the vulnerability of the homeless population to substance abuse but also signals a pressing need for targeted interventions and harm reduction strategies.

# 4 Model and Results

This dataset was processed and analyzed using the R programming language (R Core Team (2023)), as well as tidyverse (Wickham et al. (2019)), tidyr (Wickham, Vaughan, and Girlich (2023)) and dplyr (Wickham et al. (2022)) programming packages. The package janitor (Firke (2023)) was used to clean column names, and knitr (Xie (2021)) was used to generate the final R Markdown report. ggplot2 (Wickham (2016)) was used to make the graphs featured throughout the paper. Finally, knitr (Xie (2021)) was used to generate the final R Markdown report.

The first aspect of the data I investigated is an analysis of the trend in total deaths among homeless individuals per year. This figure provides a clear view of the data distributed on an annual basis and may be useful for understanding the trend. There was a slight decrease in the number of deaths from the beginning of 2017 to 2018. However, starting in 2019, the numbers began to rise and reached their peak level in 2021. From 2022 onwards, the numbers began to decrease again. The peak was attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a substantial increase in both non-fatal and fatal overdoses in the shelter system and the broader community. In response, the Integrated Prevention and Harm Reduction Initiative (iPHARE) was established in December 2020 as a multi-pronged effort by the City and community agencies to address opioid-related deaths in Torontoâ€™s shelter system (Toronto Public Health, 2022). For the graph, The x axis represents the passage of time, specifically the years for which data on the total deaths of homeless people is being presented. Each point on the x-axis corresponds to a specific year, allowing you to track changes and trends over time. The y-axis represents the total number of deaths of homeless individuals. This is a measure of the cumulative or aggregate number of deaths in a given year. The higher the point on the y-axis, the greater the total number of deaths among the homeless population for the corresponding year.

# Read data from CSV file
Homeless_deaths_by_month <- read.csv("Homeless_deaths_by_month.csv")

ggplot(Homeless_deaths_by_month, aes(x = Year.of.death, y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") + # Bar plot
  labs(title = "Total Deaths per Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Deaths") # Titles and labels


```

The next aspect of the data that I analyzed was the trend in the age of death among people experiencing homelessness, broken down by gender for each year. I categorized the gender into male and female, where on the left side of the graph, you can observe the trend of the age of death for females experiencing homelessness, while the right side represents the trend for males. Each bar represents the total deaths for each age group (age below 20, age between 20 - 39,age between 40 - 59, and age above 65 or more). Therefore, this graph provides insight into the age trends of death for homeless individuals.

Research suggests that the median age of death for people experiencing homelessness in 2022 was 55 years for males and 42 years for females. For comparison, the median age for the general population in Toronto is 79 years for males and 84 years for females (Toronto Public Health, 2022). Especially when you observe the graph, you'll notice that the age group between 40 and 59 years old old stands out. 




```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Read data from CSV file
Homeless_deaths_by_demographics <- read.csv("Homeless_deaths_by_demographics.csv")
# Data preprocessing: Filtering out 'Unknown' Gender and 'Unknown' Age_group
filtered_data <- Homeless_deaths_by_demographics[!(Homeless_deaths_by_demographics$Gender %in% c('Unknown', 'Transgender') | 
                                                    Homeless_deaths_by_demographics$Age_group == 'Unknown'), ]

  labs(title = "Total Deaths by Gender and Age Group per Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Deaths",
       fill = "Age Group") + # Titles and labels
